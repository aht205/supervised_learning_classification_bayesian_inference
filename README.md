# Bayesian Inference & Classification â€“ Advanced Statistical Methods

This project contains my **Advanced Topics in Statistics** coursework, demonstrating Bayesian modelling using JAGS and multiple machine learning classification algorithms in R.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**Part A â€“ Bayesian Inference**
- Hierarchical model of reaction times for schizophrenic vs. non-schizophrenic individuals.  
- Implemented in **R + JAGS** using MCMC sampling.  
- Diagnostics: traceplots, Gelmanâ€“Rubin statistic, posterior summaries.  
- Focus: parameter inference (`beta`, `tau`, `lambda`) and predictive model validation.

**Part B â€“ Classification**
- Compared **KNN**, **QDA**, **Random Forest**, and **SVM** on a synthetic dataset.  
- Evaluated models using **Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity**, and **AUC**.  
- Applied **cross-validation** (caret) and visualised **ROC curves** with `plotROC`.

Findings (headline bullets)
	â€¢	Bayesian: posterior summaries separate groups meaningfully; diagnostics (trace/GR) acceptable.
	â€¢	Classification: KNN/QDA competitive; AUCs ~0.88â€“0.89 on the provided dataset; RF/SVM comparable.
	â€¢	Reproducibility: single .Rmd runs end-to-end; dependencies listed above.
